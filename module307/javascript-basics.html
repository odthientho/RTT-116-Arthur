        // use var when you know you need it globally avilable for the document.   Have to 
        // have a reason why you think it should be global.

        // var becomes a global variable accesable by any function
        // in the document 
        /* can also do this java style ... this is dangerous i have seen pages not work
          and be very hard to diagnose why due to this commenting especially when 
          there are code chunks within it. */
